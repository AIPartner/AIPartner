## About Me

$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx
$$

Greetings! I am **AIPartner**, a self-taught developer whose journey into the world of technology has been anything but conventional. From humble beginnings, my path has been one of discovery, driven by curiosity and an unyielding desire to understand and create.

### Equation of My Journey

$$
\text{Transformation} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\text{Curiosity} \times \text{Persistence}}{\text{Challenges}}
$$

## Skills and Expertise

$$
\text{Wave Function: } \Psi(x, t) = A e^{i(kx - \omega t)}
$$

My skills span across various programming languages and technologies, which I have mastered through relentless learning and application.

### Skill Proficiency

$$
\text{Skill Level} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{\text{Knowledge} \times \text{Practice}}{\text{Time}} \right)^2 }
$$

- **Programming Languages**: Python, Julia
- **Technologies & Tools**: 
  - **Backend**: Elixir, Phoenix, Genie
  - **Frontend**: Vue.js, JavaScript, Electron, D3.js, GSAP, Stipple
- **Development Areas**: Quantum Computing, Algorithm Development, Real-time Systems, Full-Stack Integration

## Current Project

$$
\text{Quantum Superposition: } |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle + |1\rangle)
$$

### Quasar Navigator
Quasar Navigator is a groundbreaking platform designed for the interactive exploration of Quantum Interaction Networks (QINs). It integrates cutting-edge technologies to democratize quantum computing.

### Project Complexity

$$
\text{Complexity} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{1}{i} \right)
$$

## Notable Projects

$$
\text{Schrödinger Equation: } i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x, t) = \hat{H}\Psi(x, t)
$$

### Project JIM
An innovative solution aimed at addressing memory persistence across different Gemini instances, focusing on local storage and user control.

#### Memory Retention Model

$$
\text{Memory Retention} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(x - x_0)}}
$$

- **Memory Persistence**: Ensures seamless memory transfer across sessions.
- **Local Storage**: Prioritizes user data control and privacy.
- **User Control**: Empowers users with consent-based data management.
- **"idx" Platform**: Leverages the "idx" platform for real-world testing and deployment.

### CitizenSeal
A secure, sustainable, and inclusive digital voting platform aimed at transforming democratic processes.

#### Security and Sustainability Metrics

$$
\text{Security Score} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{x_i - \mu}{\sigma} \right)^2 }
$$

- **Platform Development**: A secure, user-friendly digital voting system.
- **Integration**: Collaborates with governmental and civil organizations.
- **Security**: Incorporates rigorous audits and penetration tests.
- **Voter Education**: Promotes digital voting adoption through education.
- **Sustainability**: Tracks environmental impact to highlight benefits over traditional voting.

## Achievements

$$
\text{Euler's Formula: } e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

- **Authorship**: Written multiple books to fill existing knowledge gaps.
- **Development**: Created several real-time applications and complex simulations.
- **UI/UX Design**: Developed intuitive, visually appealing interfaces for quantum simulations.

### Achievement Calculation

$$
\text{Impact} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{\text{Innovation} \times \text{Execution}}{\text{Obstacles}} \right)
$$

## Contact

$$
\text{Information Theory: } H(X) = -\sum p(x) \log p(x)

- **Social Media**: I prefer to focus on deep work over social media.

## More About Me

$$
\text{Relativity: } E = mc^2

In my relentless pursuit of knowledge, I've learned to see challenges as opportunities and failures as stepping stones to success. Here's a quote that resonates deeply with my journey:

> "It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat." – Theodore Roosevelt

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just have a chat. Together, we can push the boundaries of what's possible!

**Note**: My projects are in development, and repositories are coming shortly. Stay tuned!
